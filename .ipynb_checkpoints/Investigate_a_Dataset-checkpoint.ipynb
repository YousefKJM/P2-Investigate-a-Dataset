At the end of this section, describe the questions that you plan on exploring over the course of the report. Try to build your report around the analysis of at least one dependent variable and three independent variables. If you're not sure what questions to ask, then make sure you familiarize yourself with the dataset, its variables and the dataset context for ideas of what to explore.\n",

There should be an 'Upload' button in the upper right that will let you add your data file(s) to the workspace. You can then click on the .ipynb file name to come back here."
